## AI Contributions

AI tools were used occasionally as a support resource during development.  
They helped mainly with understanding Angular project structure, resolving build and
configuration errors, and suggesting improvements for UI styling and layout.

Some code snippets and explanations were used as references, but all logic,
component integration, routing, and feature implementation were manually written
and adapted to fit the project requirements.

AI was mainly used as a learning and troubleshooting aid rather than as a primary
code generator.
