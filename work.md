# Project Work Documentation

## Task Overview

The goal of this project was to build a Job Application Tracker using Angular.
The application allows users to manage job applications by adding, viewing,
editing, and organizing them. It also includes a dashboard to visualize application
status and a calendar view to track upcoming interviews.

The project was structured using Angular standalone components, routing,
services, and models to maintain clean separation of concerns.

## Easy Tasks

Some parts of the project were straightforward to implement, such as:
- Creating Angular components (Dashboard, Job List, Job Form, Calendar View)
- Setting up routing between pages
- Designing basic forms for job applications
- Displaying application data using lists and cards

These tasks mainly relied on standard Angular features and best practices.

## Challenging Parts

Several parts required more effort and problem-solving:
- Fixing routing and module import errors during project setup
- Resolving build errors related to component paths and template references
- Organizing the project structure using standalone components
- Improving the UI styling to avoid a flat or overly white interface

These challenges required debugging, restructuring files, and refining styles
to achieve a clean and usable interface.

## Extra Features (Bonus)

- Dashboard statistics cards showing application status counts
- Calendar view for upcoming interviews
- Improved global styling with a modern and professional look
- Reusable services and models for better maintainability
